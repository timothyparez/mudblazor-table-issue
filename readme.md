## Introduction

This is a sample app to present an issue I'm facing with `MudTable` and editing data

### How to use

 1. Run the application: `dotnet run`
 2. Try to edit some data in the table
 3. As soon as you switch fields or commit the data automatically reverts

I'm probably doing something wrong here but I'm not seeing it.
